    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Happy birthday, Lina!!!</b></h1>

    <p style="text-align: center;">So in addition to your fancy new headband, I also bought you a domain name for a year! Congratulations, you are the proud new owner of <i>carolynannehill.com!</i></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">What can you do with a domain name?</h2>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">EMAIL</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">You have a couple of options for how you can use a domain name as your email address.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4 style="font-size: larger;"><b>Alias service</b></h4>
            <h5 style="font-size: medium;"><i>**HIGHLY recommended for personal use - simple, most private + secure, convenient</i></h5>
            <p>Think of an alias as a middleman for your email communications. Instead of giving an individual or company your personal email, you can give them an alias that will still allow you to send and receive emails through your existing account, with no noticeable difference.</p>
            <p>I recommend you use it with an email aliasing service, specifically <a href="https://simplelogin.io">SimpleLogin</a>. For $30/year ($2.50/month), you can create as many aliases as you want and even create them on the fly. For example, if you want to sign up for a new service called Hello, you can use <i>hello@carolynannehill.com</i> as your login email when creating the account, even if you have not set up an alias with that name. Or if you don't want to give someone your real email address, just give them <i>*anything*@carolynannehill.com</i>. You will still be able to send and receive emails from your regular email account, but the recipient will never know your real email and won't be able to leak/abuse it. If you start getting spam sent through that alias, you will know it is because of that sender and you can delete or disable the alias with no effect on your regular email.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 style="font-size: larger;"><b>Email account</b></h4>
            <h5 style="font-size: medium;"><i>**Recommended for business use and some individuals who know what they're doing</i></h5>
            <p>Another option is to upgrade your existing email address to one using your domain name. You could pay Google to transfer your current email address (@gmail.com) to one at your domain (@carolynannehill.com). Or you could decide to go with another email service (I use <a href="https://protonmail.com">ProtonMail</a>) and create a new email address with your domain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 style="font-size: larger;"><b>Direct forwarding</b></h4>
            <h5 style="font-size: medium;"><i>**Not recommended, but free</i></h5>
            <p>This is similar to an alias in that it allows you to create an address (for example, contact@carolynannehill.com) that will forward anything it receives to your email. The issue is that you can't reply using this email, and some services may be able to detect that it's not an email account.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
        
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">URL</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">This one can be whatever you want it to be - it can be fun or useful and as simple or complex as you want it to be!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4 style="font-size: larger;"><b>Website</b></h4>
            <h5 style="font-size: medium;"><i>**Recommended for use as a portfolio or blog</i></h5>
            <p>You know what a website is (I hope). But what you may not realize is how useful it can be for individuals as a resume/portfolio. If done well, it will make you stand out in the crowd. It is fully customizable, can link to personal projects, and can share some fun things about your personality.</p>
            <p>Another use for a website would be to host a blog. This may sound like a big undertaking, but if you enjoy writing, it can be a fun new hobby to explore. There aren't any requirements for how often you need to post, and even if no one reads it, it's still a good creative outlet and resume builder!</p>
            <p>This is a website I wrote myself and is being hosted on <a href="https://github.com/carolynannehill/carolynannehill.github.io">GitHub</a> for free. Making a good looking website from scratch takes time and technical know-how most people don't want to commit to. However, there are some website building services that eliminate all of the coding and give you a simple interface to edit your website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 style="font-size: larger;"><b>Link Redirects</b></h4>
            <h5><i style="font-size: medium;">**Recommended for convenient access (and sharing) of other URLs</i></h5>
            <p>This one is kinda cool. Have you ever seen a bit.ly link? (Hint: you have because I've used them before) Essentially you can use your domain to link to anything you want. Maybe you have a Google Doc you find yourself sharing? Set <i>mygoogledoc.carolynannehill.com</i> to point to it. Want to easily give people your social media accounts? Send them <i>instagram.carolynannehill.com</i> or <i>snapchat.carolynannehill.com</i> and it will directly open your account in their app! Maybe you have a Spotify playlist you like to share? Easy! <i>myplaylist.carolynannehill.com</i>!</p>
